                <h2><i>What is Student Relationship Management?</i></h2>
                <p>
                    The University of Liverpool and the Department of Computer Science currently store a lot of information about students in
                    multiple databases, which users access via many different systems. The use of too many systems poses time efficiency problems
                    as well as a steep learning curve for any novice user, such as new students or lecturers. The proposed solution will help
                    alleviate these issues and offer a central location for staff and students to access student information and communications.
